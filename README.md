<h3>Hi there âœ‹. In this project, I've created a Web Page mainly using Bootstrap. In the project;</h3>
<ul>
  <li>I've created a website using mainly Bootstrap5,</li>
  <li>Project includes a responsive toggle navbar,</li>
  <li>Carousels,</li>
  <li>Cards, etc., </li>
  <li>I've tried to style almost everthing in the page by using Bootstrap,</li>
  <li>Used boootstrap d-flex for aligning HTML elements, </li>
  <li>m, mt, mb, mx, my, p, pb, pt, px, py etc. for giving margins and paddings,</li>
  <li>text-danger, text-warning, display, w-75, w-100 etc., for styling issues,</li>
  <li>From my point of view one of the most important advantages of Bootstrap is to allow user design responsive columns for sm, md, lg, xl, etc. screens by using grid system. And of course I've used them too. </li>
  <li>I've received icons from Font Awesome,</li>
  <li>Gif image of the project is below ðŸ‘‡. </li>
  <li>Hope you like my project!</li>
  <li>All comments and contributions are welcomed!</li>
</ul>
